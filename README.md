  ## Description

  The aim of this project was to take an existing repo that used REST api principles and to refactor it using Apollo and GraphQL. The website itself is a book search engine that allows users to login, search for books online using an external Google API, and then save and delete any book preferences to their profile.

  ## Installation

  Once the repo is cloned locally you can run `npm run install` to install both frontend and back end dependencies simultaneously. From there you can run locally with the `npm run develop` command. If you wish to create an optimised build you will need the `npm run build command`. The app uses MongoDB for the database technology so you will need this installed on ypur machine, or available in your production environment.

  Once up and running you will need to first create an account using the login/signup window. From here you can use the search bar to search for a book by title. Each card that gets returned has a save button appended to the bottom that you can use to save the book to your profile. On the See Your Books page you can see saved preferences and delete as appropriate
